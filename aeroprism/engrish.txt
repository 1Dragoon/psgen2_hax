suffering of the past.  The knowledge of Alisa and her fellow

Good morning, Eusis.  My apologies for calling you in so

Hmm...[Push][More]You've been working for me about two years now?[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
Yes.[Push][More]I am forever grateful for you taking an orphan like me under your 
wing and making me an agent, sir.[Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
No, I simply gave you the opportunity.[Push][More]You became an agent on your own merits.  [Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
I guess.[Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
Moving on...[Push][More]What I am going to ask of you will be the toughest and, by far, 
the most important mission you've ever done.[Push][More]It is crucial to the future of Motavia.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...?[Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
As you well know, I'm not exaggerating when I say Algol's rapid 
development is solely due to Mother Brain.[Push][More]Part of my duty is to oversee Mother Brain's development plans 
for Motavia.  Afforestation has been progressing smoothly, and I 
have no doubt it was for the best.[Push][More]But now, Biomonsters flagrantly roam Motavia![Push][More]Why do they exist?  How can we stop them?  We have to find 
the answers to these questions.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...?[Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
Eusis, your mission is to recover the [Purple][Important]System Recorder[White] from 
the [Green]Biosystems Lab[White].[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
The [Purple][Important]System Recorder[White]?[Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
It's evident that the [Green]Biosystems Lab[White] experienced an accident 
two years ago.  By analyzing the [Purple][Important]System Recorder[White], we can 
conduct a proper investigation into what transpired.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...?[Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
We must find a way to control these Biomonsters!  I think we'll 
find a solution once the [Purple][Important]System Recorder[White] is recovered.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
But, wasn't an agent sent to investigate the source of the 
accident when it first happened?[Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
You mean Shelley?[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...[Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
Unfortunately, she never reported her findings.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
What?![Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
The report from Data Memory indicates she ceased all 
communications two weeks ago.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
Does that mean...[Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]
She's a skilled agent!  However, I must admit, I am concerned.[Push][More]I presume something unusual must have happened.  Eusis!  Can I 
entrust this mission to you?[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
Yes, sir![Push][More][Blue]Governor O'Connor[White]

I have been reporting in regularly.  
What in Algol do you mean? [Push][More][Portrait4][Blue]Eusis[White]
What did you say?  What's going on?[Push][More][Portrait0][Blue]Sherry[White]
I went and checked out the [Green]Biosystems Lab[White].

I may look like a simple space pirate, but it's just a cover.[Push][More]I was tired of Mother Brain's total control over my life.  
I snuck off Palma and started to roam space.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...[Push][More]Kind of an extravagant ship for a vagabond, wouldn't you say?  
Not only that, but you said that being a space pirate is a 
cover...a cover for what?  Who are you, really?[Push][More][Blue]Tyler[White]
Hey, check the attitude at the door.  
I've rescued you and even returned all your things.  
A thank you wouldn't go amiss about now.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...[Push][More]You did save our lives...  Thank you.[Push][More][Blue]Tyler[White]
No worries.

But I DO mean.[Push][More]My group has been watching you and your friends.  
We knew you were imprisoned on [Green]Gaira[White] and I was sent to get 
you.  
I'm glad I reached you in time.[Push][More]Incidentally, Mother Brain really screwed the pooch this time, 
losing a rich, productive world like Palma.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
What do you mean?[Push][More][Blue]Tyler[White]
Arranging the deaths of her enemies in so-called accidents is a 
method she's often used in the past...[Push][More]In other words, she had [Green]Gaira[White] crash into Palma to make it look 
like you and your friends died in an accident.[Push][More]The public would accept that story, and anti-Mother Brain 
elements would not increase in number.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...[Push][More][Blue]Tyler[White]
However, [Green]Gaira's [White] velocity on impact was way over what Mother 
Brain had predicted...[Push][More]It's a real shame.  Palma didn't stand a chance.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
If what you say is true, IF it's true, then what in Algol is Mother 
Brain?[Push][More][Blue]Tyler[White]
A cancer.  For humanity's sake, Mother Brain should not exist.  
At least, that's what I think![Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
I'm not sure one way or the other right now.[Push][More]I do know one thing: I will never forgive those who treated Nei's 
life as some plaything![Push][More][Blue]Tyler[White]
Now I see why my group has been keeping tabs on you.[Push][More]Let's put our cards on the table.  My group thinks you might be 
sympathetic to our cause.  
I'll take you to [Green]Paseo[White].  What you do after that, is up to you.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
Tyler, you have my thanks.[Push][More][Blue]Tyler[White]
...[Push][More]If...if you share our beliefs and suspect Mother Brain, you should 
head for Dezoris![Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]

I'm glad you have made it this far...[Push][More]I am Mizeris Lutz Isa Lanai.  If you prefer, you may simply call me
"Lutz."  
I may very well be the last Esper in Algol.[Push][More]You are Eusis, I presume?[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]

[Blue]Lutz[White]
You do not remember me.  This is the second time we have met.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
The second time?[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
Yes...[Push][More]You were ten years old.  You accompanied your parents on a 
spaceship tasked with planetary exploration outside of Algol.  
There was an accident.  That is when we first met.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
Huh?[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
I woke up at that moment.  I summoned the Light of Tajim and 
revived you.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
The Light of Tajim?[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
It is the embodiment of my old master's power.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
But, how...why?[Push][More]Why did you save me?[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
In truth, the voice of Alisa roused me from my deep sleep.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
Alisa?[Push][End]
-----end string----- 15b5

[Blue]Eusis[White]
Alisa Landale...[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
You have seen her before.[Push][More]In your nightmares, she represents beautiful Algol fighting 
against an evil being.  
That entity is [Red]Dark Falz[White]![Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
[Red]Dark Falz[White]...[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
[Red]Dark Falz[White] is the manifestation of a profound evil.[Push][End]

It conspired against Algol, plotting our demise from the shadows.
 However, [Red]Dark Falz[White] was no match for Alisa's might.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
After one thousand years, [Red]Dark Falz[White] has returned![Push][More]Long ago, I summoned my fellow Espers here.  We knew this day 
would come...[Push][More]We combined our power to create a series of weapons and armor 
capable of defeating [Red]Dark Falz[White].[Push][More]We sealed them in towers that we have hidden behind 
gravitational fields.  The towers are invisible to all.[Push][More]Eusis, you must retrieve the weapons and armor!
This [Purple][Important]Aeroprism[White] will disrupt the gravitational field and let you 
access the towers.[Push][More]"Nei" is a ancient, hallowed name that has come to mean 
"negation": in other words, the neutralization of evil.
If you bring the Nei items before me, I will recognize you, Eusis, 
as Alisa's rightful heir.[Push][More]A word of caution.  Once you use the [Purple][Important]Aeroprism[White] to reveal the 
towers, Mother Brain will detect them immediately.
You have a monumental task ahead of you.[Push][More]Now go!  Acquire the Nei items before evil engulfs all of Algol![Push][End]

Well done!  I was right to trust in you.
I knew you would succeed.[Push][More]Alisa's blood runs in your veins.
You have proven to me that you are worthy of your ancestral 
legacy.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
Alisa and her fellow heroes saved Algol one thousand years ago, 
ushering in a brief period of peace.[Push][More]People lived simple, fulfilling lives without want or greed.  
Everyone was happy.[Push][More]This changed all too quickly with the advent of Mother Brain.[Push][More]Mother Brain created everything anyone could want and more.  
People lost sight of what was truly important.[Push][More]They became greedy, enthralled by the creations of Mother 
Brain.  The covetous people began to lie, steal, and fight each 
other for them.[Push][More]People eventually forgot all about Alisa and her compassion.[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
It was then that I realized, that the people of Algol were wholly 
dependent on Mother Brain.[Push][More]She had corrupted them and I felt evil stir.  Algol was falling into 
ruin before my very eyes![Push][More]Who had ensnared us, and for what purpose?  I still do not 
know...[Push][More][Blue]Eusis[White]
...[Push][More][Blue]Lutz[White]
